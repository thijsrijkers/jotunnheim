# jotunnheim
<small>üõ°Ô∏è A way to incrementally replace webpages  </small>

<h2> Goal of this project</h2>
<p>The goal of Jotunnheim is to provide a easy way to show webpages when you for example are migrating webpages to a new variant. Take the scenario that you have a website that is based on PHP and your creating the same website to a Javascript one. With Jotunnheim you could introduce one webpage at a time to slowly migrate your old website to the new one. </p>

<h4> Functionality goals </h4>
<p> Jotunnheim should be able to replace routing when a new webpage is linked with Jotunnheim. When this page is not working or erroring, it should revert to the old page to keep the website/application up. Also, Jotunnheim should be able to at limits to visit of a webpage. For example, you want to set a new webpage live but not to a large group. Jotunnheim should be able to put a limit on this. For example you want only the first 100 visitors of your page to see the new variant, after reaching this limit it should display the old webpage. With this you can control the amount of visitor satisfaction. </p>
